## Paper 1

**Assignment:** Write a referee report on Einstein’s 1905 paper on special relativity

**Due date:** Friday of Week 5

**Length:** 4–5 double-spaced pages. You should use standard margins (1-inch to 1.25-inches on each side of the page) and a 12-point font. Acceptable file formats include .doc, .docx, and .pdf.

**Grade:** Your grade on Paper 1 will contribute 25% of your final course grade.

## Paper 2

**Due date:** Friday of Week 8

**Length:** 6–7 double-spaced pages. You should use standard margins (1-inch to 1.25-inches on each side of the page) and a 12-point font. Acceptable file formats include .doc, .docx, and .pdf.

**Grade**: Your grade on Paper 2 will contribute 20% of your final course grade.

For paper 1, you completed a close reading of a primary source. For paper 2, you will engage with questions about physics and its institutions. Such institutional arrangements may include specific types of research centers, sources of funding, modes of training new researchers, communication networks among colleagues, and so on.

Using several sources, you will evaluate the relationships between a particular set of ideas and the institutions in which they were embedded. You should select one of the following topics and compose an essay of 6-7 double-spaced pages.

- **Option A: General Relativity and the Ivory Tower**
- **Option B: Institutions and the Quantum Revolution**

While preparing your essay, you should consider at least three of the readings listed below. Use them as resources to help you articulate and defend a specific argument. The goal of the assignment is not to summarize the readings or merely paraphrase the authors’ arguments, but rather to articulate your own position and defend it using specific examples and evidence from these readings.

- Readings for Option A: General Relativity and the Ivory Tower
- Readings for Option B: Institutions and the Quantum Revolution

A good way to craft an argument or thesis statement is to frame it as the answer to a specific question. Consider the difference between these two candidate thesis statements: (a) “The French Revolution was a time of important changes in society.” (b) “Though often described as a radical departure from previous social and political conditions, the French Revolution ultimately had more in common with the Ancien Régime than with modern democratic societies.” The first example would likely be followed by summaries of information. The second example presents a specific argument that requires supporting evidence and documentation within the body of the paper.

When drawing on readings, use standard footnote conventions and include a bibliography of    
sources cited at the end.

## Paper 2 Revision Exercise

**Assignment:** Revise paper 2. Your revised paper should again be 6-7 double-spaced pages, using standard margins and a 12-point font.

**Due date:** Friday of Week 11

Revision means to see again, to take a fresh look at the overall product, and to improve the work in a substantial way. The standards for the revision are higher than for the original paper. Only making superficial revisions—such as fixing typos or adding occasional sentences in response to particular comments from the instructors—will not improve your grade. Rather, to improve your grade, you should re-think your paper from top to bottom. These guidelines should help.

### Steps for this revision:

1. What is the thesis? Clarify it, if necessary. Avoid overgeneralization, or a thesis that merely states the obvious. What can you say about this material that gives the reader new insight?
2. Is there a clear introduction? Does it state the thesis and give a sense of the structure of the paper? Delete any waffly, redundant, or unnecessary parts.
3. Can you, in a single line, identify how each paragraph contributes to the overall thesis? If any paragraph has two or more significant contributions, split it into multiple paragraphs. If a single point is pursued in several paragraphs, combine them. If any paragraph contains merely additional, unnecessary material, delete it.
4. Organization: what is the argument of the paper; how is that argument structured? Is there a way to make the argument stronger? Consider rearranging sections, paragraphs, or sentences to make the essay’s argument more effective. Identify additional points that need to be addressed, and points that can be deleted.
5. Transitions: once the organization is settled, ensure that the flow of the paper is clear, and that each paragraph fits smoothly into the paper.
6. Evidence: are the points backed up with evidence? Is every key piece of evidence addressed, and every point at least illustrated? Is everything cited accurately? Note where additional evidence would strengthen the essay, or where the evidence given is not a good match for the point being made.
7. Logic and analysis: does the essay make the most of its evidence? Is it fully interpreted? Do the interpretations convince you, or is there illogic, an absence of analysis, or other problems?
8. Tone: is the tone appropriate? Is it too stiff? Too casual? What phrases or words would you change?
9. Sentence level check: are any sentences unclear? Mark them, and try to clarify. Remove weak phrases, chop out any extra words, reduce long sentences into more brief ones, and make sure there are no sentence fragments.
10. Conclusion: is it strong? Does it restate the thesis and make a stronger claim than the introduction does?

### Editing Steps:

- Check spelling and grammar (commas, semi-colons, ellipses, quotations, the works).
- Check footnotes and bibliography: are they in the correct format?
- Read the essay again—backwards, if necessary—to make sure everything makes sense and that no words are missing.
- Make sure each sentence has a subject, and that subjects and verbs agree with each other.
- Check the verb tenses of each sentence, and make sure they don’t change randomly.

## Paper 3 

**Due date:** Wednesday of Week 15

**Length:** 10–12 double-spaced pages. You should use standard margins (1-inch to 1.25-inches on each side of the page) and a 12-point font.

**Grade:** Your grade on Paper 3 will contribute 35% of your final course grade.

For this assignment, you will be writing a 10-12 page paper that advances your own specific, historical argument and supports it by citing primary and secondary sources. You should place a priority on clear expression, and write for an intelligent audience that has not necessarily read the sources in question. Your paper should include a clearly stated and focused thesis, and it should support that thesis using properly cited primary and secondary sources. Your paper must draw on at least two primary sources and at least four secondary sources. You may choose to write about either of the two topics listed below.

- **Option A: Physics and Politics in the United States after World War II**   
    Did the relationship between physics and politics in the US change after the war? If so, how, why, and over what time period? Did the changes affect only certain physicists, or the field of physics more generally?
- **Option B: German Physicists and Nuclear Weapons Research During World War II**   
    Did German physicists’ attitudes toward the nuclear program differ from one another? Did their engagement with nuclear weapons change over the course of the war? If so, how, why, and over what time period? How did they characterize their work during and after the war?

A good way to craft a historical argument is to frame it as the answer to a specific question. Consider the difference between these two candidate thesis statements: (a) “The French Revolution was a time of important changes in society.” (b) “Though often described as a radical departure from previous social and political conditions, the French Revolution ultimately had more in common with the Ancien Régime than with modern democratic societies.” The first example would likely be followed by summaries of information. The example presents a specific argument that requires documentation and defense in the body of the paper.

For each paper topic, we have compiled a list of references and made them available on the course website. You are not required to restrict yourself to these sources; however, you are strongly encouraged to talk with Prof. Kaiser and/or your teaching assistant to help you identify additional sources that might be of interest. Likewise, if you prefer to write about a different topic, you must discuss your topic ahead of time with us, so that we can help you identify good sources to use.

- Readings for Option A: Physics and Politics in the United States after World War II
- Readings for Option B: German Physicists and Nuclear Weapons Research During World War II

### Making Good Use of Sources:

A “primary source” is any text written by a physicist or other historical figure at the relevant historical moment. For example, the 1949 report by the General Advisory Committee (GAC) to the Atomic Energy Commission is a primary source; the article analyzing the GAC report by historians Peter Galison and Bart Bernstein (“‘In any light’…”) is a secondary source.

The goal of this paper is not to summarize what other historians have said about the topic. Instead, you should use those historians’ writings to help you craft your own argument. In a historical paper, primary and secondary sources play different roles. The best historical arguments are ones that are shaped by careful reading and interpretation of the primary sources and by paying attention to what other historians have said about these primary sources and their contexts in secondary sources. Primary sources should be analyzed and interpreted, whereas secondary sources should be referenced to provide background information, or their arguments can be built upon or questioned in your paper.

### How to Get Started:

- First, you should do a close reading of your primary sources. What is the meaning of the source? Who wrote it, when and where was it written? Are there obvious ways that the text has been shaped by its social, cultural, intellectual, institutional, or political context? What is taken for granted by the author? What remains ambiguous or unclear at the end of your reading? What do the authors assume about their readership?
- Next you should read your secondary sources to determine how scholars have interpreted the events in question and to identify relevant themes or sources. Have historians understood these primary sources in the same way that you do? How do they position these sources in the flow of history? What points have been particularly interesting, contentious, or murky? What is your own interpretation about the events in question and how does it fit with theirs?
- As you are reading and rereading your sources, take detailed notes. You will need to know where you found a particularly interesting quotation or idea so that you can cite the source properly. Proper footnote and bibliography citations are required.
- When you start to compose your paper, think carefully about its structure and organization. Do you have an introductory paragraph that sets up the problem, clearly states your thesis, and outlines your ensuing discussion? Do each of the points that you raise in the body of your paper support your thesis in a clear and compelling way? Do you have a concluding paragraph that wraps up your argument and gestures at its wider significance? Is your writing concise, precise, and explicit? Is it lively?
