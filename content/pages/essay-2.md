**Due date:** Friday of Week 8

**Length:** 6–7 double-spaced pages. You should use standard margins (1-inch to 1.25-inches on each side of the page) and a 12-point font. Acceptable file formats include .doc, .docx, and .pdf.

**Grade**: Your grade on Paper 2 will contribute 20% of your final course grade.

For paper 1, you completed a close reading of a primary source. For paper 2, you will engage with questions about physics and its institutions. Such institutional arrangements may include specific types of research centers, sources of funding, modes of training new researchers, communication networks among colleagues, and so on.

Using several sources, you will evaluate the relationships between a particular set of ideas and the institutions in which they were embedded. You should select one of the following topics and compose an essay of 6-7 double-spaced pages.

- **Option A: General Relativity and the Ivory Tower**
- **Option B: Institutions and the Quantum Revolution**

While preparing your essay, you should consider at least three of the readings listed below. Use them as resources to help you articulate and defend a specific argument. The goal of the assignment is not to summarize the readings or merely paraphrase the authors’ arguments, but rather to articulate your own position and defend it using specific examples and evidence from these readings.

- Readings for Option A: General Relativity and the Ivory Tower
- Readings for Option B: Institutions and the Quantum Revolution

A good way to craft an argument or thesis statement is to frame it as the answer to a specific question. Consider the difference between these two candidate thesis statements: (a) “The French Revolution was a time of important changes in society.” (b) “Though often described as a radical departure from previous social and political conditions, the French Revolution ultimately had more in common with the Ancien Régime than with modern democratic societies.” The first example would likely be followed by summaries of information. The second example presents a specific argument that requires supporting evidence and documentation within the body of the paper.

When drawing on readings, use standard footnote conventions and include a bibliography of sources cited at the end.
